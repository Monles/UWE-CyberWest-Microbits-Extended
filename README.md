# Aim 🏍️

- This repository is the extended version of [Activity: A (micro)Bit of Radio Security](https://github.com/uwe-cyber/micro-bit_of_radio_security).
- The overview of this [UWE - CyberWest Teacher Workshops](https://github.com/uwe-cyber/teachersworkshop2024/blob/main/lesson-microbitradiosecurity.md) can be viewed via the link.

### 🍵 Brief

- Students will use the micro:bits to communicate with each other via radio. Initial communication will be done as a broadcast and in plaintext.
- Students will then work through the use of pairing and “encrypted” communication.
- The exercise has been designed to cover the importance of secure communication and use of coding within cyber security.

### ❇️ Already experienced with micro:bits?

Please go to the section "Start the Game! 🤖" below. It's time for fun!

### ✳️ Prerequisite

- 2 x BBC micro:bits(v2)
- Basic foundation of Python and micro:bits

### ✅ How to get familiar with Python and Micro-bit?

- For micro:bits and python usage for it, go to [https://microbit.org/code/](https://microbit.org/code/)
- More Python? [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) is your good friend.

# How to start? 🛼

### 🛹 Method 1

1. Download the hex file in this repository
2. Drage the hex file to the folder of micro-bits

### 🛴Method 2

1. Go to [https://microbit.org/code/](https://microbit.org/code/)
2. Open Python Editor
3. Copy and paste the code to the python editor
4. Press "Save" button on the right-bottom side (.hex), you can choose to download python file or hex file(this one is set by default)
5. Drag the hex file to the folder of microbit
6. Run it and have fun 🤞

## 🏀 Task 1 - Morse code in plaintext broadcast

Think about what you can do to find the real message...

- What does each character represent in morse code? (Hint: They are all upper-case!)
- Space between each morse code means... ?
- How to translate the morse code into English alphabets?

### How to play?

1.  &nbsp;Press B to start "Pairing" process (micro:bit A)
2.  &nbsp;Press A & B to complete the pairing (micro:bit B)
3.  &nbsp;Press A to type Morse Code (micro:bit A), then
    - Press A to type '.' (Dot)
    - Press B to type '-' (Dash)
    - Touch Logo to type ' ' (Space)
    - Shake micro:bit A 🫨 OR Press 'A & B', so you can see all the message you type manually. It's a good way to review the massage before sending it.
    - Move micro:bit A towards the ground slowly to send the decrypted message
    - Move micro:bit A to the right to send the encrypted message

### 🍧 Have fun with Morse code

I prepare a sample for you to have a look at how Morse code wroks.
