# Aim 🏍️
- This repository is the extended version of [UWE - CyberWest Teacher Workshops](https://github.com/uwe-cyber/teachersworkshop2024).
- The overview of this [Activity: A (micro)Bit of Radio Security](https://github.com/uwe-cyber/teachersworkshop2024/blob/main/lesson-microbitradiosecurity.md) can be viewed via the link.

### 🍵 Brief
- Students will use the micro:bits to communicate with each other via radio. Initial communication will be done as a broadcast and in plaintext. 
- Students will then work through the use of pairing and “encrypted” communication. 
- The exercise has been designed to cover the importance of secure communication and use of coding within cyber security.

## 🏀 Task 1 - Morse code in plaintext broadcast

Think about what you can do to find the real message...
- What does each character represent in morse code? (Hint: They are all upper-case!)
- Space between each morse code means... ?
- How to translate the morse code into English alphabets?

### 🍧 Have fun with Morse code
I prepare a sample for you to have a look at how Morse code wroks.
